globs:

- output the changelog as markdown when asked.
- git tags are used to mark the commit that cut a new release of the gem
- the gem version is located in [version.rb](mdc:lib/model_context_protocol/version.rb)
- use the git history, especially merge commits from PRs to construct the changelog
- when necessary, look at the diff of files changed to determine whether a PR should be listed in
  - ## Added; adds new functionality
  - ## Changed; alters functionality; especially backward compatible changes
  - ## Fixed; bugfixes that are forward compatible

use the following format for changelogs:

```markdown
# Changelog

## Added
- New functionality added that was not present before

## Changed
- Alterations to functionality that may indicate breaking changes

## Fixed
- Bug fixes

#### Full change list:
- [Name of the PR #1](https:/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ruby-sdk/pull/1) @github-author-username
- [Name of the PR #2](https:/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ruby-sdk/pull/2) @another-github-author
```

always add `Full change list:` and list the PRs merged since the last update to [version.rb](mdc:lib/model_context_protocol/version.rb)
